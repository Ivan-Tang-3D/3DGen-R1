## 💥 News
- **[2025.12.15]** AR3D-R1 \#3 paper of the day in HuggingFace Daily Papers ! 🔥
- **[2025.12.11]** We release the [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/IvanTang/3DGen-R1/tree/main) of one-step AR3D-R1 and the inference code! 🔥
- **[2025.12.11]** We release the [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10949). 🔥

## 💪 Get Started
### Installation
Please set up the Python environment by:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate environment_name

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
My environment setup is mainly based on [ShapeLLM-Omni](https://github.com/JAMESYJL/ShapeLLM-Omni). If you only need inference, installing this repository is sufficient.

## 💫 Inference   
You can download the checkpoint from [here](https://huggingface.co/IvanTang/3DGen-R1/tree/main)
```
python demo.py
```

## 💫 Evaluation with Metrics
We provide an evaluation script that supports both inference and metrics calculation:

```
python eval.py
```

**Configuration:**
- Modify the `model_path` in `eval.py` to point to your downloaded checkpoint
- The script is compatible with the inference pipeline and adds comprehensive metrics evaluation
- Supports batch evaluation on test datasets with automatic metric computation
